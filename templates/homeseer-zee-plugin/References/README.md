## Important!
The needed HomeSeer sdk references are not included. You can find them in the latest hs3linux_zee package (http://www.homeseer.com/updates3/hslinux_zee_3_0_0_125.tar.gz)

* HomeSeerAPI.dll
* HSCF.dll
* Scheduler.dll

Alternatively you can launch `./gradlew homeseerCopySdkReferences` , or build completely by running `./gradlew buildAll`
