--------------------------

You have just created a simple C# HomeSeer-plugin-project (for hslinux_zee). You'll find a build file (`build.gradle`) and a draft HSPI class to get started.

To compile the project, simply run any of the commands:

    ./gradlew buildDebug
    ./gradlew buildRelease
    ./gradlew buildAll

To publish the project as maven artifacts to mavenLocal():

    ./gradlew publishXamarinPublicationToMavenLocal
